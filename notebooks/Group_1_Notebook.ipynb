    "#### 2.1 Credit Scoring\n",
    "Credit scoring models evaluate the default risk (probability of not paying back) of any applicant applying for a loan. Several Methods have been developed since Durant first publication in 1941. For an overview see Lessmann et al. (2015). Credit Scoring models are trained on accepted cases only. This creates a sampling bias, since rejected cases are left out and therefore are not representive for the whole population of possible borrowers. Historically, Reject Inference methods have been used to tackle the problem. In Reject Inference we build a model for the accepted cases and extrapolate it for the rejected ones using several methods, which we will discuss in a seperate section. In this notebook we try to add a special type of neural network, namely an Autoencoder, to our Reject Inference methods to achieve a reduction of the sampling bias."
